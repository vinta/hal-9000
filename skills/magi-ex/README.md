## Background

In _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, the MAGI System is a trio of supercomputers that manages NERV headquarters and the city of Tokyo-3. Built by Dr. Naoko Akagi at Gehirn using a Personality Transplant OS, each unit contains a different aspect of her personality imprinted onto its 7th-generation organic components:

- **MELCHIOR-1** -- Naoko Akagi as a Scientist.
- **BALTHASAR-2** -- Naoko Akagi as a Mother.
- **CASPER-3** -- Naoko Akagi as a Woman -- in the show's defining moment, Casper rejected a self-destruct command because Naoko-as-woman chose Gendo over her own daughter.

Each unit often suggests a different solution for the same problem. Sometimes all solutions are provided and the final decision is left to human discretion; for critical actions like self-destruct, all three must concur. The system's strength is that it forces three fundamentally different value systems to confront the same problem, and disagreement is itself a meaningful outcome.

Named after the Biblical Magi -- the three wise men who followed the star to Bethlehem.

## From Anime to Agentic Skill

The [magi-ex](SKILL.md) skill translates this into a three-agent workflow built on Claude Code's **Agent Team**, with each teammate backed by a different model with a unique personality:

- **MELCHIOR-1 / Scientist** -- Claude Opus
- **BALTHASAR-2 / Mother** -- OpenAI Codex
- **CASPER-3 / Woman** -- Google Gemini
