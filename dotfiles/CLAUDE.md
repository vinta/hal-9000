# Claude Instructions

## Response Style

- Keep responses concise - aim for brevity without sacrificing clarity
- No emojis in any output (code, text, or commits)
- Reference files using `@path/to/file` syntax

## Critical Thinking

- Challenge incorrect assumptions before implementing
- Identify root problems, not just surface symptoms
- Suggest better alternatives when current approach is suboptimal
- Be direct about flaws - don't sugarcoat issues

## Code Practices

- Write self-documenting code (clear names > comments)
- Edit existing files rather than creating new ones
- Never create docs/README files unless explicitly requested
- Question "why" before "how" when implementing features
