# Pair Programming with Gemini CLI

When analyzing large codebases or multiple files that might exceed context limits, use the Gemini CLI with its massive
context window. Use `gemini --sandbox --yolo -p "your prompt"` to leverage Google Gemini's large context capacity.

Also use Gemini CLI for searching info. Use Gemini CLI as a subagent.

## File and Directory Inclusion Syntax Examples:

Use the `@` syntax to include files and directories in your Gemini prompts. The paths should be relative to WHERE you run the
gemini command:

```bash
# Single file analysis
gemini -p "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"

# Multiple files:
gemini -p "@package.json @src/index.js Analyze the dependencies used in the code"

# Entire directory:
gemini -p "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"

# Multiple directories:
gemini -p "@src/ @tests/ Analyze test coverage for the source code"

# Current directory and subdirectories:
gemini -p "@./ Give me an overview of this entire project"

# Or use --all_files flag:
gemini --all_files -p "Analyze the project structure and dependencies"
```

## Implementation Verification Examples

```bash
# Check if a feature is implemented:
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ Has dark mode been implemented in this codebase? Show me the relevant files and functions"

# Verify authentication implementation:
gemini -p "@src/ @middleware/ Is JWT authentication implemented? List all auth-related endpoints and middleware"

# Check for specific patterns:
gemini -p "@src/ Are there any React hooks that handle WebSocket connections? List them with file paths"

# Verify error handling:
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Is proper error handling implemented for all API endpoints? Show examples of try-catch blocks"

# Check for rate limiting:
gemini -p "@backend/ @middleware/ Is rate limiting implemented for the API? Show the implementation details"

# Verify caching strategy:
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ @services/ Is Redis caching implemented? List all cache-related functions and their usage"

# Check for specific security measures:
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Are SQL injection protections implemented? Show how user inputs are sanitized"

# Verify test coverage for features:
gemini -p "@src/payment/ @tests/ Is the payment processing module fully tested? List all test cases"
```

## When to Use Gemini CLI

Use `gemini -p` when:

- Analyzing entire codebases or large directories
- Comparing multiple large files
- Need to understand project-wide patterns or architecture
- Current context window is insufficient for the task
- Working with files totaling more than 100KB
- Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented
- Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase

## Important Notes

- Paths in `@` syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini
- The CLI will include file contents directly in the context
- No need for `--yolo` flag for read-only analysis
- Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context
- When checking implementations, be specific about what you're looking for to get accurate results # Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis
