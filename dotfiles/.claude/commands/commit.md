# Commit Guidelines

## Key Rule: **Separate Unrelated Changes**

Before committing:

1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to review changes
2. Group related changes together
3. Commit each group separately using `git add [specific files]`

## Commit Message Format

- `feature: [description]` - new features
- `fix: [description]` - bug fixes
- `refactor: [description]` - code refactoring
- `docs: [description]` - documentation updates
- `test: [description]` - test changes
- `chore: [description]` - maintenance tasks

## Rules

- One logical change per commit
- Ensure code works before committing
- Don't commit if tests fail or build is broken
- Include co-authorship:
